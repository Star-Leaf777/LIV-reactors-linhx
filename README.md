This project is used to analyze data from short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments with LIV mechanism, including Double Chooz, RENO and DayaBay

# Code Source Introduction

This project consists of three programs. They are used to

- program one : Survival probabilities with LIV, Reactor neutrino oscillation spectra, $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ results under standard oscillation model.
