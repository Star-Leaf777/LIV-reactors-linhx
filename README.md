# LIV-reactors-linhx
This project is used to analyze data from short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments with LIV mechanism, including Double Chooz, RENO and DayaBay. It is a supplement for article

# Code Source Introduction

This project consists of two programs. 

- reactor_fluxcheck : Survival probabilities with LIV, Reactor neutrino oscillation spectra, $\sin^22\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ results under standard oscillation model.
- LIV_minizer_lat : Calculation for minimum of $\chi^2_\text{SG}$ and $\chi^2_\text{PG}$
